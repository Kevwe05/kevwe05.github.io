# Project Background

GONG Inc. is a fictional e-commerce company that specializes in selling office supplies online. GONG Inc. has accumulated substantial data across its sales, product offerings, discounts, and customer demographics. The objective of this project is to analyze that data to uncover insights that will help improve commercial success.

This project applies end-to-end data analytics process, from extracting data to building an interactive dashboard for tracking KPIs.

The tools and methods used include:

-	SQL for extracting datasets from relational database (PostgreSQL)
-	Power BI for building the data model, conducting exploratory data analysis, and creating an interactive dashboard
-	DAX functions for generating key metrics and calculations
-	Statistical methods for forecasting and analyzing trends, product performance, customer behavior, and order fulfillment

# Data Structure and Initial Check

The data used in this project, as pictured below, comes from four primary tables with a total row count of 8,001 records.

1.	Customer Table: Includes customer ID, age, state, region, and segment. Customers from Utah and Nebraska were excluded from the analysis.
2.	Sales Table: Contains transaction data for orders made between 2015 and 2017, including order details, discounts, and sales amounts.
3.	Products Table: Contains product information including product ID, category, subcategory, and price.

Prior to the beginning of the analysis, a variety of quality checks were conducted including
- Data Cleaning: Ensuring no missing or inconsistent data for key metrics such as sales values and product IDs.
-	Data Filtering: Excluding customers from Utah and Nebraska and orders made outside the 2015 â€“ 2017 period.
-	Data Integrity: Verifying relationships between tables, ensuring proper joins for analysis.

## Product Performance

The product performance analysis identified key products driving revenue and profitability for GONG Inc. Office chairs were the top sellers, while technology had the highest average order value. However, some product categories underperformed in terms of both sales and profitability, offering opportunities for optimization.

### Key Insights:

-	Top-Performing Products: Office Chairs, Desks, Technology (including phones, copiers, electronics etc.)

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made to help GONG Inc. improve its overall commercial performance:

1.	Marketing Campaigns: Partnership with the marketing team to make efforts in improving sales within the Gen Z category of customers
2.	Optimize Discount Strategy: Perform A/B testing to determine if an increase or decrease in discount rates would increase customer orders, subsequently increasing revenue especially during peak sales periods.
3.	Product Line Adjustment: Increase visibility on underperforming product categories, while continuing to promote high-margin products.
4.	Root-Cause Analysis: Investigate further the reason behind sales dip in non-peak performing periods and determine if there might be ways to mitigate this.
